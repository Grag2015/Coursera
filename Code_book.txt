## Study design
I've read data from files X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt and merged them by column to create test set . 
(see data frame test_set)
Then, I've read data from files X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt and merged them by column   
to create training set. (see data frame train_set)
I've merged obtained sets by rows to create one data set. (see data frame Union_set)
Next, I've extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
(for example, was extracted variables tBodyGyroJerkMag-std(), tBodyGyroMag-mean(), and so on)
So in data set
