## about raw data
The dataset includes the following files:
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## Study design
I've read data from files "X_test.txt", "y_test.txt", "subject_test.txt" and merged them by column to create test set . 
(see data frame test_set)
Then, I've read data from files "X_train.txt", "y_train.txt", "subject_train.txt" and merged them by column   
to create training set. (see data frame "train_set")
I've merged obtained sets by rows to create one data set. (see data frame "Union_set")
Next, I've extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
(for example, was extracted variables tBodyGyroJerkMag-std(), tBodyGyroMag-mean(), and so on) (see data set "Union_set_mean_std")
Finally, using the data set "Union_set_mean_std", I've obtained new data set (named "output") with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


## Code book
In this section I've described each variable in data set "output"
"activity_id" -  obtaine code of activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)    
"subj" - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.                        
"activity_name" - activity name
